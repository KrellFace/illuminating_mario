# Illuminating Mario
Platform for testing illumination algorithms within the domain of procedural level generation for Super Mario Bros
 
Designed to work with the Mario AI Benchmark (https://github.com/amidos2006/Mario-AI-Framework)

This platform generates simple Mario levels comprised of only solid blocks and empty space, and produces meta data to support comparison between the performance of different illumination algorithms in different configurations

## Basic Installation

1. First, clone the latest version of the Mario AI Framework
2. Then, clone this respository as a subfolder within the Framework's repository (at the same level as the src, levels & img folders)

## Using the platform
To start a new experiment you need to run genericFunc.ExperimentalRun.java. This should bring up the interface to allow you to design a run of an illumination algorithm to generative basic Mario levels

## Future Work
This repository was developed during my MSc and it is undoubtedly in need of some attention. In future it needs a comprehensive review and refactor to compress and improve the codebase.
